# The aim of this program is to demonstrate the working principle of Binary Search Algorithm.

## This is a number guessing game where the player needs to guess the randomly selected "lucky number" from a shuffled list of numbers.

- #### randomList() is used to generate n unique random numbers (adjustable).
- #### This list is shuffled to randomize their order.
- #### And a number is randomly selected from the shuffled list as the "lucky number".
- #### The list is sorted to be used for binary search.
- #### If a non integer is entered by the player, it prompts for a number.
- #### if the player's guess is in the list, the program ends with a message accordingly.
- #### if the player's guess is valid and within the range of the sorted list. A binary search algorithm is used to narrow down or direct the user towards the lucky number, printing half the initial list that contain the lucky number.
- #### If the guess is correct, it prints "You Won!" and exits the loop.
- #### If the list items has been narrowed down to an item, the game ends with a printout of the lucky number.
- #### At the end of every operation the program prints the number of attempts it took for the player to guess the correct number.
